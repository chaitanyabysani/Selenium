/*If you talk about Webdriver Listener so you should make a note of some classes and interfaces that we will use so will talk about it.

1- WebDriverEventListener – This is an interface, which have some predefined methods so we will implement all of these methods.

2-EventFiringWebDriver- This is an class that actually fire Webdriver event.

Why we are using Webdriver Listeners

If you talk about Webdriver we are doing some activity like type, click, navigate etc this is all your events which you are performing on your script so we should have activity which actually will keep track of it.

Take an example if you perform click then what should happen before click and after click.

To capture these events we will add listener that will perform this task for us.*
